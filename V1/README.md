A comprehensive, AI-powered Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for pharmaceutical continuous granulation processes. This project demonstrates the integration of advanced machine learning (Transformer models), control theory, and industrial process simulation.

## Overview

PharmaControl-Pro is a complete end-to-end system that:
- Simulates a realistic pharmaceutical granulation plant with nonlinear dynamics and disturbances
- Trains a Transformer-based predictive model to forecast process behavior
- Implements a robust MPC controller that autonomously steers the process to desired targets
- Provides comprehensive performance analysis and visualization tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.8+
pip install torch pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn optuna tqdm joblib
```

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PharmaControl-Pro
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Execute the notebooks in sequence:

1. **Notebook 1**: Build and test the advanced plant simulator
2. **Notebook 2**: Generate data and perform preprocessing with soft sensors
3. **Notebook 3**: Train and validate the Transformer predictive model
4. **Notebook 4**: Implement and test the MPC controller
5. **Notebook 5**: Run closed-loop simulation and performance analysis

Each notebook is self-contained with detailed explanations and can be run independently after the data generation step.

## Technical Highlights

### Model Architecture
- **Encoder**: Processes historical CMAs and CPPs using self-attention
- **Decoder**: Generates future predictions using cross-attention with planned control actions
- **Positional Encoding**: Injects temporal information into sequences

2. **Apply Constraints**: Filter out unsafe or invalid actions
3. **Predict Outcomes**: Use trained model to forecast results for each candidate
4. **Optimize**: Select action minimizing weighted cost function
5. **Execute**: Apply first step of optimal plan (receding horizon)

### Data Processing
- **Chronological Splitting**: 70% train / 15% validation / 15% test
- **Feature Scaling**: MinMaxScaler fitted only on training data
- **Sequence Generation**: Sliding window approach for time-series samples
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient PyTorch DataLoader implementation

## Performance Metrics

The system is evaluated using industrial control standards:
- **Settling Time**: Time to reach and stay within ¬±5% of target
