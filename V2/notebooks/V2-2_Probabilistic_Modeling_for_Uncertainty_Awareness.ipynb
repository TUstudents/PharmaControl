    "# V2 Notebook 2: Probabilistic Modeling for Uncertainty-Awareness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project:** `RobustMPC-Pharma` (V2)\n",
    "**Goal:** Upgrade our predictive model to be uncertainty-aware. We will build a **probabilistic model** that outputs not just a single prediction, but a full predictive distribution (mean and standard deviation). This allows the controller to know how confident the model is, enabling safer, risk-adjusted decision-making.\n",

    "\n",
    "A standard neural network provides a **point forecast**—a single best guess for the future. This is useful, but it can be dangerously overconfident. The model has no mechanism to communicate when it is operating in a region of high uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We care about two main types of uncertainty:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Aleatoric Uncertainty:** Inherent randomness or noise in the process itself. This is irreducible noise that the model can learn to represent.\n",
    "*   **Epistemic Uncertainty:** Uncertainty due to a lack of knowledge. This happens when the model encounters data that is very different from what it saw during training (out-of-distribution data). This is the uncertainty in the model's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **probabilistic model** captures both. It outputs a probability distribution (e.g., a mean and a standard deviation) for its prediction. A controller using this model can then make more robust decisions. For example, if the model is very uncertain (high standard deviation), the controller might choose a more conservative, safer action."

    "## 2. Method: Probabilistic Forecasting with Monte Carlo Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to create probabilistic neural networks. One of the simplest and most effective techniques is **Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is surprisingly simple:\n",
    "1.  Train a standard neural network that contains **Dropout layers**.\n",
    "2.  At inference time, instead of turning off Dropout (which is the standard `model.eval()` behavior), we **keep it active**.\n",
    "3.  Because Dropout randomly deactivates neurons, each forward pass through the network will produce a slightly different result.\n",
    "4.  We perform `N` forward passes on the same input data. This gives us a sample of `N` different predictions.\n",
    "5.  The **mean** of this sample serves as our final prediction.\n",
    "6.  The **standard deviation** of this sample serves as our measure of model uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique effectively treats our single trained network as an ensemble of many smaller, slightly different networks, providing a robust way to estimate uncertainty without changing the training process significantly."
