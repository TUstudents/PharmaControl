    "\n",
    "Our V1 MPC controller used an **exhaustive search** over a discretized lattice. This approach has two critical flaws:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **It is not scalable.** The number of possible plans grows exponentially with the number of control variables and discretization steps. For 3 CPPs with 3 discretization steps each, we had `3^3 = 27` candidates. For 5 CPPs with 5 steps, we would have `5^5 = 3,125` candidates. This quickly becomes computationally impossible to evaluate in real-time.\n",
    "2.  **It is not expressive.** To keep the search space small, we had to assume a very simple control plan: 'make one change and hold it constant'. This prevents the controller from finding better, more dynamic solutions like gradually ramping a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a smarter way to search. Instead of checking every single possibility, we can use an **evolutionary algorithm** that intelligently explores the search space to find near-optimal solutions quickly."

    "## 2. Introduction to Genetic Algorithms for Control Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. It 'evolves' a population of candidate solutions towards a better outcome over several generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our MPC problem, the concepts map as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Individual / Chromosome:** A single, complete control plan. This is a sequence of `H` future CPP values.\n",
    "*   **Population:** A large collection of these control plans (e.g., 100 different individuals).\n",
    "*   **Gene:** A single CPP value at a single future time step within a plan.\n",
    "*   **Fitness Function:** Our MPC cost function. It evaluates a control plan (an individual) and assigns it a score (lower is better). This is the 'environment' that determines survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolutionary process works in a loop:\n",
    "1.  **Selection:** The 'fittest' individuals (plans with the lowest cost) are more likely to be selected to 'reproduce'.\n",
    "2.  **Crossover:** Two parent plans are combined to create a new offspring plan, mixing characteristics from both (e.g., taking the first half of Plan A and the second half of Plan B).\n",
    "3.  **Mutation:** Small, random changes are introduced into the new offspring's genes. This maintains genetic diversity and helps escape local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "After many generations, the population converges towards a set of high-fitness individuals, one of which will be our optimal control plan."
