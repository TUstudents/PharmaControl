# RobustMPC-Pharma V2: Design Document

## Project Overview

**Theme:** Robustness and Adaptability

V2 represents a complete re-architecture of the pharmaceutical process control system, moving from a prototype demonstration to an industrial-grade, uncertainty-aware controller. The focus shifts from "proof of concept" to "production ready" with formal robustness guarantees and adaptive capabilities.

## Core Philosophy: From Reactive to Proactive Control

V1 was fundamentally **reactive** - it responded to the current state without accounting for uncertainty or learning from past performance. V2 is **proactive** - it anticipates uncertainty, maintains memory of disturbances, and continuously improves its decision-making strategy.

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. **Modular Library Design: `robust_mpc`**
Instead of monolithic classes, V2 implements a composable library where each component has a single responsibility and can be independently tested and improved.

### 2. **Uncertainty-Aware Throughout**
Every prediction comes with confidence bounds, and the controller explicitly accounts for this uncertainty in its decision-making process.

### 3. **State Estimation Foundation**
Raw sensor measurements are filtered through a Kalman Filter to provide smooth, reliable state estimates that prevent jittery control behavior.

### 4. **Intelligent Optimization**
Replaces brute-force search with Genetic Algorithms capable of exploring complex action spaces including ramps, multi-step sequences, and continuous adjustments.

### 5. **Offset-Free Control**
Implements integral action to eliminate steady-state errors caused by unmeasured disturbances - a critical requirement for industrial applications.

## Key Technical Innovations

### **1. Risk-Aware Optimization**
The cost function uses Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) to make risk-averse decisions:
```python
risk_adjusted_prediction = prediction_mean + beta * prediction_std
cost = calculate_cost(risk_adjusted_prediction, setpoint)
```

### **2. Integral Action for Offset Elimination**
Maintains internal disturbance estimate updated based on tracking error:
```python
tracking_error = setpoint - filtered_measurement
self.disturbance_estimate += integral_gain * tracking_error
corrected_prediction = model_prediction + self.disturbance_estimate
```

### **3. Advanced Action Parameterization**
Genetic algorithms enable complex action sequences:
```python
# Instead of constant actions, optimize ramps and sequences
chromosome = [initial_value, ramp_rate, hold_duration, final_value, ...]
```

### **4. Uncertainty Propagation**
Prediction uncertainty is explicitly modeled and propagated through the optimization:
```python
mean_trajectory, std_trajectory = model.predict_distribution(state, actions)
worst_case_trajectory = mean_trajectory + confidence_factor * std_trajectory
```
