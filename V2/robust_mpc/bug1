After analyzing the robust_mpc library code, I've identified a critical bug in the
  RobustMPCController class related to data scaling for the GeneticOptimizer. This bug
  would prevent the optimizer from working correctly because the parameter bounds would
   be in the wrong scale.

  Here's the bug and the fix:

   1. Bug Location: In V2/robust_mpc/core.py, the _get_param_bounds method (lines
      501-505) generates parameter bounds for the GeneticOptimizer using unscaled
      values, but the optimizer works with scaled control values.

   2. Impact: This would cause the GeneticOptimizer to generate control plans with
      values in the wrong range, leading to poor optimization results or errors.
